Welcome to my first blog post! I decided to build my portfolio site using Hugo and document the process.

## Why Hugo?

After exploring various static site generators, I chose Hugo for several reasons:

* **Speed** - Hugo builds sites incredibly fast
* **Flexibility** - Complete control over layouts and styling  
* **Markdown** - Write content in markdown with frontmatter
* **No dependencies** - Single binary, no complex toolchain

## The Emacs GNU Aesthetic

I wanted my site to have that classic Emacs/GNU terminal vibe - clean, functional, and reminiscent of the tools I use daily for coding. The dark header, monospace fonts, and terminal-inspired color scheme create that perfect developer aesthetic.

## What's Next?

I'll be writing about my experiences with:

* Machine learning and AI research
* Building scalable web applications  
* Open source contributions
* Startup experiences and lessons learned

Stay tuned for more technical deep-dives and project retrospectives!
